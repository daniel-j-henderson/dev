			<p>I'm an electrical and computer engineering major with minors in TAM and CS working at NCAR as a software engineer right now. I've been involved in digital and creative media for a few years producing church services, and I'm into all things production - audio, visual, and  lighting. That's why I added the TAM minor. You can pretty much see the extent of my web skills thus far <a href="../index.html">here</a>.</p>
